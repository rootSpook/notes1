D: I feel a bit tired...
E: Have a seat.
D: Why is it that men enjoy little more than shedding blood?
E: It could certainly be that men possess that savage side. But that is a tool by which they secure and protect a precious thing...
D: Precious thing? Like family or relationship?
E: There are some like that. But for a man before he can obtain those two... Perhaps he must come upon one other precious thing.
D: One other... precious thing?
E: For no other's sake. To accomplish it for him... for himself. A dream.
D: ...dream?
E: One who dreams of world domination, one who devotes his whole life to the through tempering of one sword. If there is a dream which takes one his whole life to find...
E: There are also dreams which, like storms, devour tens of thousands of other dreams.
E: With no relation to social status, class... background. Whether it suits them or not, people yearn for a dream.
E: Sustained by a dream, hurt by a dream, revived by a dream, killed by a dream. 
E: And even after being abandoned by a dream, it continues to smolder from the bottom of one's heart... Probably until the verge of death...
E: A man should envision such a lifetime once.	
E: A life spent as a martyr to the god named "dream".
E: ...Ultimately to be born and to then simply live for no better reason... 
E: I can't abide such a lifesytle.

D: I imagine all of our friends, too... must have come so far with us, attracted by that charm.
E: They are excellent troops. They ar my valuable comrades, devoting themselves to the dream I envision...
E: But... to me, a friend is... something else.
E: Someone who would never depend upon another's dream... Someone who wouldn't be compelled by anyone, but would determine and pursue his own reason to live...
E: And should anyone trample that dream, he would oppose him body and soul... even if the threat were me myself...
E: What i think a friends is... is one... who is my "equal."

D: What is your dream?
